# SearchRedditForMe
Browser extension that uses a search engine to search the Reddit website because the default search is so inconsistent
and I'm tired of writing site:reddit.com every single time I want to look something up
<br><br>
Installation Links<br>
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-on-reddit-tool/<br><br>
